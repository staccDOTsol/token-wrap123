# WE ALL EAT — token-wrap fork

New work lives on `codex/we-all-eat-wrap`. See [WE-ALL-EAT.md](./WE-ALL-EAT.md)
for the new Pinocchio program, implemented cook/uncook and fee-harvest instructions,
compiled SBF tests, and remaining routing/browser integration. **The WE ALL EAT
factory is not deployed.** The program and IDs documented below are inherited
upstream code, not a WE ALL EAT deployment.

This program enables the creation of "wrapped" versions of existing SPL tokens, facilitating interoperability between
different token standards. If you are building an app with a mint/token and find yourself wishing you could take
advantage of some of the latest features of a specific token program, this might be for you!

- **Program ID:** `TwRapQCDhWkZRrDaHfZGuHxkZ91gHDRkyuzNqeU5MgR`
- **IDL:** [`./idl.json`](./idl.json)
- **Docs & SDK Guide:** https://www.solana-program.com/docs/token-wrap

## Features

* **Bidirectional Wrapping:** Convert tokens between SPL Token and SPL Token-2022 standards in either direction,
  including conversions between different SPL Token-2022 mints.
* **Extensible Mint Creation:** The `CreateMint` instruction is designed to be extensible through the `MintCustomizer`
  trait. By forking the program and implementing this trait, developers can add custom logic to:
    * Include any SPL Token-2022 extensions on the new wrapped mint.
    * Modify default properties like the `freeze_authority` and `decimals`.
* **Confidential Transfers by Default:** All wrapped tokens created under the Token-2022 standard automatically include
  the `ConfidentialTransferMint` extension, enabling the option for privacy-preserving transactions. This feature is
  immutable and requires no additional configuration.
* **Transfer Hook Compatibility:** Integrates with tokens that implement the SPL Transfer Hook interface,
  enabling custom logic on token transfers.
* **Multisignature Support:** Compatible with multisig signers for both wrapping and unwrapping operations.
* **Metadata Synchronization:** Syncs metadata from unwrapped tokens (both Metaplex and Token-2022 standards) to their
  wrapped counterparts.

## How It Works

It supports the following primary operations:

1. **`CreateMint`:** This operation initializes a new wrapped token mint and its associated backpointer account. Note,
   the caller must pre-fund this account with lamports. This is to avoid requiring writer+signer privileges on this
   instruction.

    * **Wrapped Mint:** An SPL Token or SPL Token-2022 mint account is created. The address of this mint is a
      PDA derived from the *unwrapped* token's mint address and the *wrapped* token program ID. This ensures a unique,
      deterministic relationship between the wrapped and unwrapped tokens. The wrapped mint's authority is also a PDA,
      controlled by the Token Wrap program.
    * **Backpointer:** An account (also a PDA, derived from the *wrapped* mint address) is created to store the
      address of the original *unwrapped* token mint. This allows anyone to easily determine the unwrapped token
      corresponding to a wrapped token, facilitating unwrapping.

2. **`Wrap`:**  This operation accepts deposits of unwrapped tokens and mints wrapped tokens.

    * Unwrapped tokens are transferred from the user's account to an escrow account. Any unwrapped token account whose
      owner is a PDA controlled by the Token Wrap program can be used.
    * An equivalent amount of wrapped tokens is minted to the user's wrapped token account.

3. **`Unwrap`:** This operation burns wrapped tokens and releases unwrapped token deposits.

    * Wrapped tokens are burned from the user's wrapped token account.
    * An equivalent amount of unwrapped tokens is transferred from the escrow account to the user's unwrapped token
      account.

4. **`CloseStuckEscrow`:** This operation handles an edge case with re-creating a mint with the MintCloseAuthority
   extension.

    * The escrow ATA can get "stuck" when an unwrapped mint with a close authority is closed and then a new mint is
      created at the same address but with different extensions, leaving the escrow ATA (Associated Token Account) in an
      incompatible state.
    * The instruction closes the old escrow ATA and returns the lamports to a specified destination account.
    * This operation will only succeed if the current escrow has zero balance and has different extensions than the
      mint.
    * After closing the stuck escrow, the client is responsible for recreating the ATA with the correct extensions.

5. **`SyncMetadataToToken2022`**: This operation copies metadata from an unwrapped mint to its wrapped Token-2022
   mint's `TokenMetadata` extension.
    * It initializes the `TokenMetadata` extension on the wrapped mint if it doesn't already exist.
    * The caller is responsible for pre-funding the wrapped mint account with enough lamports to cover the rent for the
      added space.
    * Supports: `SPL Token -> Token-2022` and `Token-2022 -> Token-2022`.

6. **`SyncMetadataToSplToken`**: This operation copies metadata from an unwrapped mint to the Metaplex metadata
   account of its wrapped SPL Token mint.
    * It can create the Metaplex metadata account if it doesn't exist or update an existing one.
    * The `wrapped_mint_authority` PDA acts as the payer for the Metaplex program CPI and must be pre-funded with
      sufficient lamports to cover rent for the Metaplex account.
    * Supports: `Token-2022 -> SPL Token` and `SPL Token -> SPL Token`.

The 1:1 relationship between wrapped and unwrapped tokens is maintained through the escrow mechanism, ensuring that
wrapped tokens are always fully backed by their unwrapped counterparts.

## Permissionless design

The SPL Token Wrap program is designed to be **permissionless**. This means:

* **Anyone can create a wrapped mint:**  No special permissions or whitelisting is required to create a wrapped
  version of an existing mint. The `CreateMint` instruction is open to all users, provided they can
  pay the required rent for the new accounts.
* **Anyone can wrap and unwrap tokens:**  Once a wrapped mint has been created, any user holding the underlying
  unwrapped tokens can use the `Wrap` and `Unwrap` instructions. All transfers are controlled by PDAs owned by the Token
  Wrap program itself. However, it is important to note that if the *unwrapped* token has a freeze authority,
  that freeze authority is *preserved* in the wrapped token.

## Confidential Transfer extension

The `ConfidentialTransferMint` extension is added to every Token-2022 wrapped mint and initialized with the following
config:

* **No Authority:** The confidential transfer authority is set to `None`, making the configuration immutable. This
  ensures that the privacy features cannot be disabled or altered after the wrapped mint is created.
* **No Auditor:** The wrapped mints are created without a confidential transfer auditor. This means that there is no
  third party that can view the details of confidential transactions.
* **Automatic Account Approval:** New token accounts are approved for confidential transfers by default. This allows
  users to make private transactions permissionlessly.

## Customizing mint

If the current wrapped mint config does not suit your needs, please fork! A few places you are going to want to update:

- Add a new struct that implements `MintCustomizer` in `program/src/mint_customizer`
- Replace the current one in use within the processor: `program/src/processor.rs`
- Re-run tests (see `package.json`) and update/remove assertions to accommodate new config
- If wanting to make use of clients:
    - CLI: Update mint customizer type in `clients/cli/src/create_mint.rs`
    - JS: Update mint size in `clients/js/src/create-mint.ts`
